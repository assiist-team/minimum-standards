## Validation best practices

> Apply these rules with the shared schema tooling defined in `profiles/react-firebase/standards/global/tech-stack.md` (currently Zod shared between app and Functions). Update that file first if we adopt a different validator.

- **Validate on Server Side**: Always validate on the server; never trust client-side validation alone for security or data integrity
- **Client-Side for UX**: Use client-side validation to provide immediate user feedback, but duplicate checks server-side
- **Fail Early**: Validate input as early as possible and reject invalid data before processing
- **Specific Error Messages**: Provide clear, field-specific error messages that help users correct their input
- **Allowlists Over Blocklists**: When possible, define what is allowed rather than trying to block everything that's not
- **Type and Format Validation**: Check data types, formats, ranges, and required fields systematically
- **Sanitize Input**: Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- **Business Rule Validation**: Validate business rules (e.g., sufficient balance, valid dates) at the appropriate application layer
- **Consistent Validation**: Apply validation consistently across all entry points (web forms, API endpoints, background jobs)
- **Shared schemas**: Define Zod schemas in a shared package so React Native, Cloud Functions, and Firestore converters rely on the exact same rules.
