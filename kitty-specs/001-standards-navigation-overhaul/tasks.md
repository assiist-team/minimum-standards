# Work Packages: Standards Navigation Overhaul

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/001-standards-navigation-overhaul/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (user stories & requirements)

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested — testing subtasks omitted.

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package is independently deliverable and testable.

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/` generated by `/spec-kitty.tasks`.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`
- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- Includes precise file paths or modules.

## Path Conventions
- **Mobile app**: `apps/mobile/src/`
- **Shared model**: `packages/shared-model/src/`
- **UI kit**: `packages/ui-kit/src/`
- **Reference**: `ledger_mobile/src/components/BottomSheet.tsx` (bottom sheet pattern)

---

## Work Package WP01: Bottom Sheet Foundation (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Create reusable BottomSheet, BottomSheetMenu, and BottomSheetConfirmation components following the ledger_mobile reference pattern (18px top border radius, 1px border, 42×4px handle bar, 160–180ms animation).
**Independent Test**: Import each component, render with mock props, verify animation, backdrop dismiss, and handle bar display.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP01-bottom-sheet-foundation.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~300 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T001 [P] Create `BottomSheet` base component in `apps/mobile/src/components/BottomSheet.tsx` — port from ledger_mobile reference with project-local theme integration
- [ ] T002 [P] Create `BottomSheetMenu` component in `apps/mobile/src/components/BottomSheetMenu.tsx` — action list with icons, Title Case labels, dividers
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `BottomSheetConfirmation` component in `apps/mobile/src/components/BottomSheetConfirmation.tsx` — destructive action confirmation dialog with cancel/confirm buttons

### Implementation Notes
- Reference implementation: `/Users/benjaminmackenzie/Dev/ledger_mobile/src/components/BottomSheet.tsx` and `BottomSheetMenuList.tsx`
- Adapt theme tokens from `useTheme()` in `apps/mobile/src/theme/useTheme.ts`
- Use `react-native` `Animated`, `Modal`, `Pressable` — no additional dependencies
- Handle bar: 42×4px, centered, rounded, semi-transparent
- Overlay: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35)`, fades in 160ms
- Sheet slides up 180ms with `useNativeDriver: true`

### Parallel Opportunities
- All three subtasks can proceed in parallel — separate files, no cross-dependencies.

### Dependencies
- None (starting package).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Theme token mismatch between ledger_mobile and minimum_standards → verify `useTheme()` exports colors/border tokens.

## Work Package WP02: Bottom Navigation Restructure (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Restructure bottom tab navigation to show exactly four items: Standards, Scorecard, Settings, + (Create). Remove Library tab, floating Log button, and dead navigation code.
**Independent Test**: Launch app, verify bottom nav shows exactly 4 items in correct order with correct icons. Verify old Library tab and floating Log button are gone.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP02-bottom-navigation-restructure.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~450 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T004 Update `BottomTabNavigator.tsx` to render 4 tabs: Standards, Scorecard, Settings, + (Create) — remove Dashboard/Library tabs
- [ ] T005 Change Standards tab icon to `pending-actions` MaterialIcons icon
- [ ] T006 Change Scorecard tab to use a new distinct icon (e.g., `assessment` or `bar-chart`)
- [ ] T007 Wire "+" button to open Create Standard flow (navigate to StandardsBuilder or new CreateStandard screen)
- [ ] T008 Remove `StickyLogButton` component rendering from `BottomTabNavigator.tsx`
- [ ] T009 Remove `StandardsLibraryScreen` from `StandardsStack.tsx` and clean up `StandardsStack` navigator
- [ ] T010 [P] Update navigation type definitions in `types.ts` — update `BottomTabParamList`, remove unused stack params

### Implementation Notes
- Current nav: Dashboard (star) → Standards/Library (pending-actions) → Activities/Scorecard (task-alt) → Settings
- Target nav: Standards (pending-actions) → Scorecard (new icon) → Settings (settings) → + (Create)
- The "+" button is NOT a tab — it's a nav button that triggers navigation to the CreateStandard flow
- Rename `DashboardStack` → repurpose as `StandardsStack` (or merge)
- `ActivitiesStack` → rename to `ScorecardStack`
- Keep `SettingsStack` unchanged
- Remove `StickyLogButton` import and usage in `BottomTabNavigator.tsx`

### Parallel Opportunities
- T010 (types update) can proceed once T004 structure is decided.

### Dependencies
- None (can run in parallel with WP01).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Existing navigation tests may break → update `BottomTabNavigator.test.tsx`, `tabNavigation.test.tsx`
- Screen wrappers in `screenWrappers.tsx` reference removed screens → clean up

## Work Package WP03: Unified Standards Screen (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Merge Active and Library screens into one unified "Standards" screen with header menu toggles for "Show Time Bar" and "Show Inactive Standards". Inactive standards display in a dimmed state with Reactivate/Delete/View Logs actions.
**Independent Test**: Open Standards tab, verify active standards display. Toggle "Show Inactive Standards" on, verify inactive standards appear dimmed with action menus. Toggle "Show Time Bar" off, verify progress bars hide. Restart app, verify toggles persist.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP03-unified-standards-screen.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~500 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T011 Add `showTimeBar` (default: true) and `showInactiveStandards` (default: false) to `uiPreferencesStore.ts` with AsyncStorage persistence
- [ ] T012 Refactor `ActiveStandardsDashboardScreen` into unified `StandardsScreen` — consolidate active standards display as the primary view
- [ ] T013 Add kebab/header menu to Standards screen with "Show Time Bar" and "Show Inactive Standards" toggle items (use BottomSheetMenu from WP01)
- [ ] T014 Fetch and render archived/inactive standards below active standards when "Show Inactive Standards" is toggled on
- [ ] T015 [P] Apply dimmed/muted visual styling to inactive standard cards (reduced opacity, muted colors, "Inactive" badge)
- [ ] T016 Add bottom sheet action menu for inactive standards with "Reactivate", "Delete", and "View Logs" options
- [ ] T017 [P] Implement time bar visibility toggle on `StandardProgressCard` — conditionally hide progress bar based on `showTimeBar` preference

### Implementation Notes
- `useStandardsLibrary` hook already provides `activeStandards` and `archivedStandards` — reuse this
- `useActiveStandardsDashboard` provides `dashboardStandards` with progress — keep for active cards
- Inactive standards section appears below active standards with a section header
- Menu toggles: use BottomSheetMenu from WP01 or a simple kebab icon that opens the menu
- Persistence: `uiPreferencesStore` already uses `zustand/middleware` persist with AsyncStorage

### Parallel Opportunities
- T015 (inactive card styling) and T017 (time bar toggle) can proceed independently once T012 baseline exists.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (BottomSheet components for menu and action sheets).
- Depends on WP02 (navigation restructure — Standards tab must exist).

### Risks & Mitigations
- `ActiveStandardsDashboardScreen` is 31KB with many responsibilities → careful refactoring, keep existing behavior intact for active standards.

## Work Package WP04: Create Standard Flow — Step 1 (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Build the survey-style Create Standard flow navigator and Step 1 (Select or Create Activity) with progress indicator, unit/category display, inline tips, and Learn More.
**Independent Test**: Tap "+", verify Step 1 opens full-screen. Select an activity, verify unit/category display. Create a new activity inline. Verify tip displays. Tap Learn More, verify expanded explanation.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP04-create-flow-step-1.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~400 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T018 Create `CreateStandardFlow` navigator in `apps/mobile/src/navigation/` with step indicator (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) and forward/back navigation
- [ ] T019 Build Step 1 screen (`SelectActivityStep.tsx`) — FlatList of existing activities with search, plus "Create New Activity" option
- [ ] T020 Display selected activity's unit and category inline below selection (e.g., "Unit: minutes" / "Category: Fitness" or "Category: None")
- [ ] T021 Allow category assignment/change on selected activity via category picker
- [ ] T022 Add inline methodology tip: *"Pick the activity that, if you did enough of it, would make success almost guaranteed."* and "Learn More" expandable

### Implementation Notes
- The existing `StandardsBuilderScreen` is a single-screen form with modals — the new flow replaces it with 3 separate screens
- Reuse `useActivities()` hook for activity list and `useCategories()` hook for category picker
- Step indicator: simple dots or numbered bar (1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3)
- Forward/back: back arrow in header + "Next" button at bottom
- Use `standardsBuilderStore` to hold form state across steps
- "Learn More" can be an inline expandable (Animated height) or a bottom sheet

### Parallel Opportunities
- T019 (activity list) and T022 (tip/learn more) can proceed independently.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02 ("+" button in nav must route to this flow).

### Risks & Mitigations
- `standardsBuilderStore` currently tightly coupled to `StandardsBuilderScreen` → may need minor refactoring to work across multiple screens.

## Work Package WP05: Create Standard Flow — Steps 2 & 3 (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Build Step 2 (Set Volume) and Step 3 (Set Period) of the survey-style Create Standard flow, including session breakdown, day-of-week selectors, tips, and final submission.
**Independent Test**: Navigate from Step 1 to Step 2, verify unit is inherited read-only. Toggle sessions, verify fields appear. Navigate to Step 3, select period, toggle day-of-week. Complete flow, verify standard is created and visible on Standards screen.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP05-create-flow-steps-2-3.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~500 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T023 Build Step 2 screen (`SetVolumeStep.tsx`) with volume input and inherited read-only unit display
- [ ] T024 Add "Break Volume into Sessions" toggle with session count and volume-per-session fields
- [ ] T025 Add inline tip (*"Start where you can consistently win, not at your ideal level."*) and "Learn More" for Step 2
- [ ] T026 Build Step 3 screen (`SetPeriodStep.tsx`) with period selector (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom)
- [ ] T027 Day-of-week selectors (Mo–Su) hidden by default, revealed via toggle; auto-reset when switching from Weekly to other periods
- [ ] T028 [P] Normalize border radius on Step 3 elements to match design system (`BUTTON_BORDER_RADIUS` from `@nine4/ui-kit`)
- [ ] T029 Add inline tip (*"Focus on total volume per period — flexibility beats rigid daily targets."*) and "Learn More" for Step 3
- [ ] T030 Wire final submission: call `createStandard()` from `useStandards`, navigate back to Standards screen

### Implementation Notes
- Volume logic already exists in `standardsBuilderStore` — `goalTotal`, `breakdownEnabled`, `sessionsPerCadence`, `volumePerSession`, `getEffectiveUnit()`
- Period/cadence logic exists in `cadenceUtils.ts` — `CADENCE_PRESETS`, `CadencePreset`, `validateCadence()`
- Weekday options already defined in `StandardsBuilderScreen.tsx` — extract and reuse
- Step 3 border radius: use `BUTTON_BORDER_RADIUS` from `@nine4/ui-kit` for all interactive elements
- Final submission: `standardsBuilderStore.generatePayload()` → `useStandards().createStandard()`

### Parallel Opportunities
- T028 (border radius) can proceed independently.
- Step 2 and Step 3 screens can be built in parallel once the navigator from WP04 exists.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP04 (CreateStandardFlow navigator and Step 1 must exist).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Complex state management across 3 screens → ensure `standardsBuilderStore` properly persists state across navigation transitions.
- Day-of-week toggle reset edge case → explicitly test period switching behavior.

## Work Package WP06: Bottom Sheet Menu Migration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Replace all `Alert.alert()` calls and custom overlay menus across the app with BottomSheet-based menus and confirmation dialogs. Ensure all menu labels use Title Case.
**Independent Test**: Trigger every menu and confirmation dialog in the app. Verify all render as bottom sheets. Verify no `Alert.alert()` calls remain. Verify all labels use Title Case.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP06-bottom-sheet-migration.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~400 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T031 Audit all `Alert.alert()` calls and custom overlay/modal menus across the codebase — create inventory list
- [ ] T032 [P] Replace standard card action menus (3-dot menus) with `BottomSheetMenu` in `StandardCard.tsx` and `StandardProgressCard.tsx`
- [ ] T033 [P] Replace sort menu overlays on Standards screen with `BottomSheetMenu`
- [ ] T034 [P] Replace category management dialogs in `CategorySettingsScreen.tsx` with `BottomSheetMenu` and `BottomSheetConfirmation`
- [ ] T035 Replace all remaining `Alert.alert()` confirmation dialogs (delete, archive, etc.) with `BottomSheetConfirmation`
- [ ] T036 Audit all menu item labels for Title Case compliance — fix any that don't conform

### Implementation Notes
- Current Alert.alert() usage locations (from codebase analysis):
  - `StandardsLibraryScreen.tsx` — delete/archive confirmations
  - `StandardsBuilderScreen.tsx` — discard changes confirmation
  - `ActivitySettingsScreen.tsx` — delete activity confirmation
  - `CategorySettingsScreen.tsx` — delete category confirmation
  - Various screens use `Alert.alert()` for error reporting (leave these or convert to toast)
- Error-reporting alerts may be left as-is or converted to `ErrorBanner` — spec says "menus and action dialogs"
- Title Case rule: capitalize first letter of each word except prepositions (e.g., "View Logs", "Delete Standard")

### Parallel Opportunities
- T032, T033, T034 can all proceed in parallel — different files/screens.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (BottomSheet components must exist).
- Depends on WP03 (Standards screen must be unified before migrating its menus).

### Risks & Mitigations
- May miss some Alert.alert() calls in edge-case flows → thorough grep audit in T031.

---

## Work Package WP07: Active Standard Card Actions (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement bottom sheet action menu for active standard cards with Edit, Deactivate, Delete, and Categorize options. Wire each action to its corresponding behavior.
**Independent Test**: Tap 3-dot menu on active standard card, verify bottom sheet with all 4 options. Tap Edit → verify pre-populated Create flow. Tap Deactivate → confirm + verify standard moves to inactive. Tap Delete → confirm + verify standard removed. Tap Categorize → verify category picker.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP07-active-standard-actions.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~350 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T037 Create bottom sheet for active standard card actions with "Edit", "Deactivate", "Delete", and "Categorize" items (Title Case)
- [ ] T038 Wire "Edit" to navigate to CreateStandardFlow pre-populated with existing standard data via `standardsBuilderStore`
- [ ] T039 Wire "Deactivate" with confirmation bottom sheet → call `archiveStandard()` from `useStandards`
- [ ] T040 Wire "Delete" with confirmation bottom sheet → call `deleteStandard()` from `useStandards`
- [ ] T041 Wire "Categorize" to open a category picker bottom sheet → update standard's activity category

### Implementation Notes
- Edit action: load standard data into `standardsBuilderStore`, navigate to CreateStandardFlow with `standardId` param
- `useStandards` already provides `archiveStandard()` and `deleteStandard()` — reuse these
- Categorize: use `useCategories()` to get category list, update activity's `categoryId` via `useActivities().updateActivity()`
- Deactivate/Delete require confirmation — use `BottomSheetConfirmation` from WP01
- Delete is destructive → confirmation text should warn "This cannot be undone"

### Parallel Opportunities
- T038–T041 can be built incrementally but are tightly coupled to T037.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01 (BottomSheet components).
- Depends on WP03 (unified Standards screen where cards live).
- Depends on WP04 (CreateStandardFlow for Edit action).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Edit pre-population: `standardsBuilderStore` must support loading existing standard data → verify `reset()` and field setters work correctly.

---

## Work Package WP08: Polish & Edge Cases (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Handle edge cases from the spec, implement empty state, and clean up dead code from the migration.
**Independent Test**: Test each edge case scenario independently — zero standards empty state, navigate away mid-flow, day-of-week reset, activity without unit.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/WP08-polish-and-edge-cases.md`
**Estimated Size**: ~300 lines

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T042 Implement empty state for zero standards (active + inactive) — show illustration/prompt to create first standard via "+" button
- [ ] T043 Handle navigate-away during Create Standard flow — discard form state, user starts fresh next time
- [ ] T044 Handle day-of-week toggle reset when period changes from Weekly to Daily/Monthly/Custom
- [ ] T045 [P] Handle activity without unit — display "Unit: (none)" on Step 2 volume screen
- [ ] T046 [P] Clean up dead code: remove `StandardsLibraryScreen.tsx`, unused imports in `screenWrappers.tsx`, old `DashboardStack` references, `StickyLogButton.tsx` if fully unreferenced

### Implementation Notes
- Empty state: centered illustration or icon + text "No standards yet" + CTA button "Create Your First Standard" that triggers "+" action
- Navigate-away: call `standardsBuilderStore.reset()` in cleanup/unmount of CreateStandardFlow navigator
- Day-of-week reset: already partially handled in existing `StandardsBuilderScreen` — extract and reuse
- Dead code cleanup: remove files, update imports, verify no broken references

### Parallel Opportunities
- T045 and T046 can proceed independently.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02 (nav restructure complete — dead code identifiable).
- Depends on WP03 (Standards screen — empty state location).
- Depends on WP04 + WP05 (Create flow — edge cases T043, T044, T045).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Dead code removal may miss references → use TypeScript compiler errors as a safety net.
